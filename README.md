# Data-Dictionary-using-python-Script
This is a Python script to get the metadata of a table and create a data dictionary in Excel files
Using this script we can automate our task to know more about the data in the tables. This helps us understand what is available in all tables in the database.
As a data engineer one wants to know more about the table schema and to avoid creating the data dictionary manually, this automation script saves a lot of time.
